//BASICS//



//TCP/IP/UDP are types of protocols from the Protocol suite.
//Usable within the Internet and within private networks.
//Must be supplemented with port number

//Data Protocols 
Networks have to manage several kinds of Protocol Data Units (PDU)s
IP PDU = IP packet.
TCP PDU = TCP segment
APPLICATION PDU = Application PDU 
EMAIL PDU = RFC-822 message or a single SMTP command
HTTP PDU =  request or response



//DATAFLOW
App > Socket [IP] > port > TCP/UDP > Ethernet > Router >

//Information
Data is sent over in packets of information.(byte sequences)
Packets carry Control Information that complies with the encryption protocol of said Network.
Control information can also include the packet's destination(IP).

//Protocol
Solves the problem of decrypting the packet.
Dictates how said packet is structured and/or encrypted, where the destination info is located within it or how big its supposed to be
[i.e. HTTP, TCP/IP].



//Port
Range from  1 to 65,535 (0 is reserved)
A port identifies an application's socket for transmission of data.

//IP (Internet Protocol)
Primary and general method of transport (Layer 2) 
Host-to-Host transport protocol (USA to UK)
It requirest best-effort protocol from udp to breakdown packets so it may suffer from packet loss or reordering in the process

//TCP (Transfer Control Protocol)
Secondary method of transport / Uses ports (Layer 3)
End-to-End transport protocol (App to App)
Must establish a handshake before beginning connection
Fixes lost,duplicate and unordered packets
'Reliable byte-stream channel' / 'Connection-oriented Protocol'


//UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
Secondary method of transport / Uses ports (Layer 3)
End-to-End transport protocol (App to App)
Doesn't fix packets but extends IP's datagram range

//Socket
An API for managing ports, TCP and UDP which is always open for Applications to plug in and transmit.
One program can have multiple sockets running simultaneosly
Multiple programs can use the same socket simultaneously
Diff sockets = diff protocols = diff stack

//>TCP stream sockets
End-to-end protocol
Realiable byte-stream service

//>UDP datagram sockets
Best-eï¬€ort datagram service
Enables individual messages up to 65,500 bytes in length.


//DNS (Domain Name System)
Distributed database that maps IP address of server/host to domain names through the name resolution service (xxx.com)

//Local Configuration Databases
Also use name resolution service as mapping for server/hosts for Operating systems to recognise.


//DMZ
Demilitarized Zones
Refers to a quarentine zone for not particularly trusted or authenticated devices
