//Link Layer 2

For the Transport layer 4 the link layer's purpose is 
to send and recieve datagrams for the IP module via tunneling or Point-to-Point-Protocol (PPP)
while also detecting if other stations send data at the same time. 
If so, resulting in signal propagation delays or a collision.

Data-link's Protocol Data Units is known as a frame.

A frame's size can vary from from a few bytes to kilobytes,
its upperbound of size is known as the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)

::ETHERNET::
"10/Mb Ethernet" was adopted by the IEEE in 1982 under the Standard Number [802.3]
This standard includes a distributed algorithm implemented in each Ethernet network interface 
that controls when a station gets to send its data through the cable. 
This algorithm is called Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Colision Detection (CSMA/CD)
because it is part of the Media Access Control (MAC)

CSMA/CD
If the line is free, send data through
If line is busy or collision occurs, retry or timeout
Expect 16 retries before timeout



::ETHERNET-SWITCHES::
When enabled CSMA/CD is not required as the ethernet will operate in a full-duplex fashion.
Uplink-port refers to explanding a LAN via interconected, additional switches being added.

FULL-DUPLEX
Send and recieve data simultaneously.

HALF-DUPLEX
Send or recieve data one direction at a time.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FRAME FORMAT :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Frame Types

-Physical Frame  (p)
-Unicast Frame   (u)
-Multicast Frame (m)
-Broadcast Frame (b)
-ARP Frame       (g)
-Magic Frame     (a)


::ETHERNET FRAME::
Bits were encoded using a Manchester Phase Encoding with two voltage levels.
The Preamble is used to determine when a frame is arriving.  
The clock recovery determines the ammount of time between encoded bits before The Start Frame Delimiter is found.

Next we have the Tags section indicating a field with a length tag or a type tag.
If the  value in the Length/Type field is less than 1500, the field must contain a length type value however, 
If the  value in the Length/Type field is bigger or equalt to 1536, the field then indicates a type of, for example, Quality of Service(QoS) tag referrenced by [ETHERTYPES]



- Preamble pattern = 0xAA
- Start Frame Delimiter (SFD) pattern = 0xAB 
- Destination (DST)
- Source Address (SRC)
- Type/Length field
		| 802.1p tags
		| 802.1q tags
			| ARP frame type  = 0x0806
			| IPv4 frame type = 0x0800
			| IPv6 frame type = 0x86DD
			| Q-tagged frame  = Virtual Lan ID


- Inter-Packet Gap (IPG)
- Data/ Payload Section = 1500-byte MTU size
- Frame Check Sequence (CRC32)

:: :: QoS :: :: 
 Implemented only on WIFI 802.11e.
 Devices supporting QoS capabilities also support non-QoS devices.
 The QoS facility is usually deployed if the network usage is high or congested. 
 It handles changes to them 802.11 MAC layer and system interfaces in order to 
 support Multimedia applications thanks to its low jitter delivery (VoIP, Video Streaming).
 “high-throughput” stations (called HT STAs) are also QoS stations.

:: :: PPP :: ::
Internet Access over Telephone.
PPP is a layered protocol that has three components:

1 - An encapsulation component that is used to transmit datagrams over the specified physical layer.
2 - A Link Control Protocol (LCP) to establish, configure, and test the link as well as negotiate settings, options and the use of features.
3 - One or more Network Control Protocols (NCP) used to negotiate optional configuration parameters and facilities for the network layer. 
	There is one NCP for each higher-layer protocol supported by PPP.

PPP permits multiple network layer protocols to operate on the same communication link. 
For every network layer protocol used, a separate Network Control Protocol (NCP) is provided in order to encapsulate and negotiate options for the multiple network layer protocols

::VLAN::
Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) uses IEEE 802 frames called (LACPDUs)
Virtual LANs are a network support capability  designed for multiuse switched networks
These essentially isolate traffic within switches to only specific switches.
VLAN mapping can be assigned via port numbers , via IP or via MAC
by assignin a VLAN tag to a frame indicating its QoS level of priority.

<USAGE>
$ vconfig add eth1 2



:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::Link aggregation::
Occurs by deciding on a specific IP adddress as a bond address with a MASTER tag
and 2 other network interfaces eth1 &&wlan1 with a SLAVE tag 

<USAGE>
$ modprobe bonding
$ ifenslave bond0 eth0 wlan0


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
::Wake-On Lan(WOL)::
Occurs based on the arrival of certain types of packets a host is brought out of sleep.

<USAGE>
$ ethtool –s eth0 wol umgb
//This command	tells ethernet to wake up if packets of type unicast, multicast, arp or broadcast arrive.


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::Magic Packet::
Magic packets contain a special repeated pattern of the byte value 0xFF.

<USAGE>
$ wol 00:08:74:93:C8:3C
//This command	generates a magic packet that can be analyzed with wireShark
