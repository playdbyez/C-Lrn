CHAR ARGV = a 2-dimensional array of arguments per character used in when the program is executed

I.E.

  argv[0] = "a.out"


$ a.out input1

##############:: External Functions :: ###############

    MAIN POINTS
<> Always check if there are explicit return statements, otherwise pointers will be necesary for persistancy
<> Always know what the function is supposed to return on success and on error
<> Always check that required arguments are fulfilled in their due type
<> Always check if a required argument for the function is also a function
<> All functions are assignable when calling it, regardless if assigning it is a requirement for the correct output
<> All arguments to functions are copies of the original variable including the addresses




void funct(void arg1) {
}
This function has no specified return type since it is VOID
This function has no return statement
This function's argument also does not require any specific type
