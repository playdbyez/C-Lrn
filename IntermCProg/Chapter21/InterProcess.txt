[ ] Interprocess Communication (IPC) [ ]

OS-provided methods for processes to manage shared data between them.
A method of message passing can be either synchronous or asynchronous.
Employs the use of a client-server interaction where roles alternate between processes.
Concurrent processes may be either Independent Processes or Cooperating Processes.


[] METHODS []

- Signals (Unix)
    Asynchronous notification sent to a running process or specific thread within the same process to trigger a behaviour.
    Execution of a non-atomic instruction is interrupted to deliver the signal to the process' signal handler 
    Signals include: interrupt, suspend, terminate or kill
    

- Unix Domain socket / inode
    Multiple processes can communicate with a single socket via file systems as their address space

- Network Socket
    Sending data over a network interface to a local or remote process on the network or system

- Shared memory
    Processes accessing to the same memory block thereby creating a shared buffer for communication

 
Independent Processes - Cannot affect or be affected by other processes within the system
Cooperating Processes - Processes that can affect and be affected by other executing processes within the system
		        These usually cooperate by sharing data, where interprocess comms takes place.
 
>> Benefits of cooperating processes
 
[] Information Sharing 
    (shared file)
 
[] Computation speedup
    (sharing computation between threads)
 
[] Modularity
    (dividing a system into different modules)
 
[] Convenience 
    (Multi-tasking through concurrently running apps)
 
 
########################################### IPC MODELS ###################################################
>> In order to communicate, the use of IPC models is required
 
//
[]  Shared memory
     - A permanent region of memory is established for storing the information.
     - Occurs without kernel notification 

Operating system's default configurations specify that a process cannot access another process's memory space.
Thus, the OS requires that both processes agree to remove this restriction in order to use shared memory as an IPC mechanism.
 
	1. The shared memory region resides in the address space of the process creating said memory segment
	2. Other processes must attach said segment to their own address spaces
 



//
[] Message Passing
    - Messages are shared between cooperating processes
    - First process notifies the kernel and in turn it notifies the second process

>> Implementation
1. Naming
	a. Direct Communication 
		(processes specify the name of the reciever or sender)
 
	b. Indirect Communication
		(processes specify a mediator for sender and reciever)
		(mediator's port address is usually within kernel space) 
 
 
2. Synchronization
	a. blocked sender / blocked reciever [Synchronous]
		(blocked sender communication implies that the sender must wait for the receiver to ack )
		(blocked receiver communication implies that the receiver must wait for the sender to ack the sent message)
 
	b. non-blocked sender/ non-blocked reciever [Asynchronous]
		(non-blocked sender communication implies that the sender continues operation regardless of the receiver)
 
3. Buffering
	a. Zero capacity
		(Since there is no storage buffer, the sender must wait for the receiver)
 
	b. Finite capacity
		(Since the size of the buffer is limited, if the buffer queue is full then the sender must wait)
 
	c. Infinite capacity
		(There is no need to wait for the sender and the receiver is always available)



###################  [] Remote Procedure Call (RPC) [ ] ###############
Bound to ditributed computing topologies unlike Local Procedure Calls
Occurs when a process causes a procedure/subroutine to execute on a different address space within the network
Employes a client–server interaction implemented via a request–response protocol.
There is a high level of incompatibility amongst RPC protocols.


< Synchronous RPC model >
> Client initiates a RPC request to a remote server
> Server processes RPC
> Client is blocked and must wait for a response from the server 
> Server responds and the application continues


< Asynchronous RPC model >
> Client initiates a XMLHttpRequest to server
> Server processes asynchronous RPC
> Client remains open,   
> Server responds and the application continues
