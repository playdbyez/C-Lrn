//fscanf() works best with int
//creates instance of FILE
//opens file from argv for reading
//scans the file for integers and store each inside val upon success
//calling fscanf() with the option %d makes it skip spaces and newline characters
//counts how many fscanf() calls were used
//returns to the beginning of the file 
//prints the index position of every newline char
//goes to th end of the file and report its index
//its index is returned in bytes, thus providing the original file's size
