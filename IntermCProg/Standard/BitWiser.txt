[] Generally useful for encryption algorithms or video compression algorithms
[] It emplies working on binnary numbers and individual bits
[] usefull if the system have memory limitations like embedded devices
[] used often for managing permissions (rwxrwxrwx) == (777) == ( 0111 0111 0111 )
[] typical operations include:
    > Check Bits ( find out if its 1 or 0 )
    > Set Bits ( set individual bit to 1 )
    > Clear Bits ( set individual bit to 0 )
    > Toggle Bits ( set bits to the opposite of its currently value )

BitMasking
Is the trick to access only a particular bit within a process and ignore the rest.
This is done by masking the ignored bit positions with 0 and only assigning 1 to the position we want to work with
