##############:: INT MAIN :: ###############

>>>>Variations<<<<<

1. int main (){ }
2. int main (int argc, char **argv){ }
3. int main (int argc, char *argv[]){ }

INT ARGC  = the ammount of arguments when the program is executed
CHAR ARGV = a 2-dimensional array of arguments per character used in when the program is executed

I.E.
$ a.out
  argc    =  1
  argv[0] = "a.out"


$ a.out input1
  argc       =  2
  argv[1][0] = 'i'
  argv[1][1] = 'n'
  argv[1][2] = 'p'
  argv[1][3] = 'u'
  argv[1][4] = 't'
  argv[1][5] = '1'


   ########### Multiple File Compilation ######## 
  
$ gcc -c progX.c 
//creates an object file (progX.o) instead of an executable (a.out)
// object files are meant to be compiled in conjunction with other files
// usually viable when there are very many object files to be compiled together
// usually scripted for usage with the "make" command
  
  
$ gcc progX.o func.o
//linking both object files to create an executable (a.out)

$ gcc progX.c progY.c
// alternatively compiles and links both files into one executable (a.out)
