            ################## :: LINKED LIST :: ####################

> A dynamic data type that relies hevily on mallocing space for single characters / nodes

> A linked list's size is very flexible

> Useful for very large lists where any one node can be deleted at any position 

> Linked lists can follow a variety of structures to determine its sequence, including:
  - Doubly linked list (bidirectional, each node points to two other nodes)
  - Singly linked list (unidirectional, each node points to a single node)

> Deleting a node however, requires linking the node that comes after,
  to the node that comes before the node being removed in order to maintain its structure 

> Compared to a contiguous memory region known as an array, linked lists take less operations to
  manage and delete characters / nodes and maintain its structure whereas arrays take more work

> Doubly linked list structures are similar to binary tree structures, binary trees prefeer to focus 
  more heavily in the sorting of its values based on the root value
  whereas linked lists don't care much about sorting, aside of maintining a fixed "head" and "tail" of the list.
