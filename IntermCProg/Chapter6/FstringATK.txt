#########:: FORMAT STRING ATK ::##########

> Discovered circa 2001, it is rarely used today

> Implemented via C language and its formatting text functions

> This type of binary exploit occurs when an input submited is evaluated as a command by the application.

> The input is designed to change the behvaiour of the format function and cause new behaviours 
  that can compromise the security or the stability of the system.

> The method to alter the system can range from code execution to 
  reading the stack and causing a segmentation fault or a denial of service attack

I.E.
If the application uses Format Functions in the source-code, that can interpret formatting 
characters then the attacker could insert formating characters in a form of the website.
So if the printf() function is used to print the username inserted in some fields of the page then the attack bellow can be used:

printf(userName)


################### ########################## COMPONENTS #################### ##################################

[] Format Function  = converts primitive variables of the language into a string                     ( printf() or fprintf() )
[] Format String    = argument to the Format function its defined as the Text + Format Parameters    ( "this is a %s", strpt )
[] Format Parameter = defines the conversion of the Format Function                                  (        %x or %s       )



################### ########################## USEFUL FORMAT PAREMETERS #################### ##################################

[ref] - %%      = character (literal)
[ref] - %p      = external representation of a pointer to void
[val] - %d      = decimal
[   ] - %c      = character
[val] - %u      = unsigned decimal
[val] - %x      = hexadecimal
[ref] - %s      = string
[ref] - %n      = writes the number of characters into a pointer


|| ##################### ########################## EXPOSED FUNCTIONS #################### ################################## ||
Functions that request the length of file as a parameter are  more secure

[] fprintf()        = writes printf to a file
[] printf()         = output formatted string
[] sprintf()        = convert and print into a string
[] snprintf()       = prints into a string + length check
[] vfprintf()       = prints the va_arg structure to a file
[] vprintf()        = prints the va_arg structure to stdout
[] vsprintf()       = prints the va_arg to a string
[] vsnprintf()      = prints the va_arg to a string + length check

### The point of using certain format paramenters:
> %x   =   reading data from the stack
> %s   =   read characters from the process' memory
> %n   =   write an int to locations in the process' memory
> %n$x =   read the from the stack at string index n (> 7%x )
