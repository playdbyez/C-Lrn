######################:: Heap Memory ::#####################

Memory to a compiler is sorted in address-value pairs.

<> Heap memory is more flexible
<> Refers to an address location where there is an abundance of free memory far 
   enough from the address location of the program's original stack 
<> Heap memory must be freed
<> Heap boundaries can be adjusted while the program is running
