 ############################### :: BINARY SEARCH TREES :: ################################

<> Requires a sorted tree-like structure to operate on

<> A tree like structure is composed by a root node, a left subtree and a right subtree.
   Left subtrees usually hold values smaller than the root while the Right subtree holds values bigger than the root

<> The root node is used as the entry point of the structure and thus any node can be accessed via the root node

<> Tree nodes are either a branch node or leaf node:
    - Branch node = has child nodes attached bellow 
    - Leaf node   = has no child nodes bellow it

<> It is also necessary to measure certain tree parameters in order to identify it:
    - Distance between nodes =  from the current node count from 0 up to the target node  
    - Height of tree =  from the bottom node count from 1 up to the root node  


<> Binary Trees structures also vary in composition:
    - Full binary trees =  each node has 2 or no child nodes
    - Complete binary trees =  the node above a leaf node must have 
                               a sibling node attached to its parent also
