#####:: Catalan Numbers ::#####
These are definied within the combinatorics branch of discrete mathematics through the use of algebraic expressions.
Directedly tied to permutations of certain kinds.

>> Catalan Sequence [len = 20]
1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, 4862,
16796, 58786, 208012, 742900, 2674440, 9694845, 
35357670, 129644790, 477638700, 1767263190,

The above numbers are essentially a method of narrowing the ammount of permutations through a sequence of combined factors.
Thus this sequence is applied to the factor involved such that: 
factor of 0 has 1 permutation 
factor of 1 has 1 permutation
factor of 2 has 2 permutations
factor of 3 has 5 permutations ...


Catalan numbers can be found in:
[] Factorials + StackSort
(from a set of size n, there are n! permutations.
 hence a factor of n has catalan_th permutations that are stack sortable)

[] Dyck Paths & Dyck Words

[] Binary Trees
(a tree of size n has catalan_th different possible shapes)

[] Pascal's Triangle

[] Optimal Paths
( Point (0,0) to point (n,n) withouth crossing the diagonal drawn inbetween the start to end (fastes route),

[] Parenthesis Positions
