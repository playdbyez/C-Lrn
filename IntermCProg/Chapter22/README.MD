[ SUBSET SUM ]
// Target value is K and K >0
// Set A is an array of values of size N
// Can Set A be partitioned into a subset in which the sum of all elements of said
   subset turns out to be equal to the target value K ?
// Multiple solutions are possible

I.E.
A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
K = 7
Solution1 = {1,2,4}
Solution2 = {3,4}
Solution3 = {2,5}
