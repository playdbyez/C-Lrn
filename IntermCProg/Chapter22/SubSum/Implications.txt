## Rules ##
[] For a set of N elements thre are 2^N possible subsets to evaluate
[] These implementations will limit the size of N to 31
    if N is unlimited, for example N = 400
    then that would imply 2^400 possible subsets and that is incalculable

Subset sums are often studied in crpytography
In computer science, quick is equal to a polynominal-time algorithm.
Polynominal-time algorithm's execution time is bounded by a polynominal function of the input size
