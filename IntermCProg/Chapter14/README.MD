<> Recursion refers to  a very long loop fulfiled through a recursive function.  
<> Recursive functions are characterized by calling themselves at the end of the function until a easier base-case solution is reached  
<> Recursive functions are slower than iterative implementations  
<> Reursive functions push and pop themselves into the stack until the base-case is reached
